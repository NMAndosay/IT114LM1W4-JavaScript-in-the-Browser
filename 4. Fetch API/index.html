            /* Answer: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for communication between
            clients and servers over the web. HTTP requests are messages sent by a client 
            to request information from a server, and HTTP responses are messages 
            sent by the server in response to those requests.

            // Checkpoint 4.2 What is the difference between callbacks, then-catch vs await-try-catch? When should you use one over the other
            /* Answer: Callbacks, then-catch, and await-try-catch are mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations.
            Callbacks: Traditional way of handling asynchronous operations. Callback functions are passed to asynchronous functions, and they are executed when the operation is complete. Callbacks can lead to callback hell (nested callbacks) and make code harder to read.
            then-catch: Promise-based approach where the `then` method is used to handle the success case, and the `catch` method is used for error handling. It provides a cleaner syntax compared to callbacks but can still result in nested structures when chaining multiple asynchronous operations.
            await-try-catch: Modern approach using `async/await` syntax. The `await` keyword is used to pause execution until a Promise is resolved, and errors can be caught using `try-catch` blocks. It provides a more synchronous-looking and readable code structure, making it easier to reason about asynchronous code.
